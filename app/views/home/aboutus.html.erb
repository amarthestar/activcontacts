<h1>ActivContacts:<h1><br>

<h2>Over the period of time we people use multiple phone numbers and emails for communication. With that arises situation where we may loose our contacts when a phone number or email is changed.<h2><br>

<h2>ActivContacts need on situations:<h2><br>

* I sent an email to my friend after a long time and it got bounced. Is he not using this email ID anymore?<br>
* I have changed my mobile number and want a common place where people can get my ActivContact number.<br>
* I travel a lot and cannot use my same number all around the globe. But still want my people to keep in touch with me when needed.<br>
* I am moving back to Chennai from Bangalore and can't inform everyone. Need a place where people can get my current contact details with my Bangalore number.<br>
* No more I work for XYZCompany and dont have private email ID's of my colleagues. Still want to keep in touch.<br>
* My email account got hacked and no more can access my emails. Want my contacts to get my new email.<br>
* The customer service number I had for my electornic item no longer exists.<br>

Ofcourse we know there are many other reasons for some one to be here...<br>

We tried to solve this problem with our concept ActivContacts where people are linked with their past and present email ID's / Phones Numbers. Hope this application ActivContacts will address this problem and opens door for other new Ideas.
